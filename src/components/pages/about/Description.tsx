          I've had the opportunity to work with large-scale datasets, developing KPIs, automating
          reporting processes, and building dynamic dashboards with Power BI. My daily work involves
          tools like SQL, Python, Power Query, and DAX to deliver accurate and scalable analytics.    
          With a strong foundation in business intelligence and continuous learning in advanced
          analytics, I've recently completed a Data Science program at MIT, where I deepened my
          understanding of machine learning, data modeling, and predictive techniques.
